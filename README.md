# Official repository for the Convex Envelope Method (CEM) 

## Purpose of this repository / Quickstart
This repository contains an implementation of the CEM, which enables to reproduce all results shown in [1] (therein, the CEM is explained in detail). For reproduction of the results, download the repository (and the underlying folder-structure) and run main.py. On a local machine, we recommend setting all items in the dictionary actors_parallelized in main.py to 0 (this will disable usage of parallelization).

## General description of the CEM
The CEM constructs all liquid phase equilibria over the whole composition space for a given system with an arbitrary number of components. This is an important feature that can be used within chemical process simulations as it enables to calculate occuring phase splits in liquid mixtures. To achieve this, the composition space is discretized, and the convex envelope of the Gibbs energy graph is computed. Employing the tangent plane criterion, all liquid phase equilibria can be determined robustly. 

## Detailed description of this repository
### How does this implementation work?
The CEM proceeds in the following order:
##### 1. Discretization of composition space
The composition space is discretized within point_discretization.py by specifying the number of components and the minimum distance between the points (specified by recursion steps $r$). This distance is equal to $\frac{1}{2^r}$ in point_discretization.PointDisc. An example for the generation of multiple discretizations is given right at the start of main.py.

##### 2. Determination of Gibbs energy graph and convex envelope
The following steps are executed within MiscibilityAnalysis (see lle.py). The Gibbs energy graph is computed using $g^E$-models as for example NRTL or UNIQUAC (see thermo_models.py). The convex envelope is found by scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.

##### 3. Classification of simplices of the convex envelope
In this step, all simplices of the convex envelope are classified (either they model a phase split or not). This is done within MiscibilityAnalysis (see lle.py) and can be executed parallelized if specified (see below). After the classification, the phase equilibrium is stored (mainly as .npy files) and can be used for the computation of phase splits. For systems with 3 or 4 components, plotter.py provides the possibility to plot the resulting phase equilibria.

##### 4. Computation of phase splits
The function MiscibilityAnalysis.find_phase_split (see lle.py) allows the computation of a phase split for a given feed flowrate. Beforehand, the phase equilibrium has to be constructed (steps 1-3) or loaded.

### Usage of the CEM for other systems
To use the CEM on other examples, provide property data (e.g., NRTL interactions parameters and feed streams) within property_data.py in the same way as for the published systems. Using property_data.InitClass within main.py, the CEM can access the specified property data and construct the desired phase equilibria.

### Parallelization
As described in [1], parts of the CEM can be executed parallelized. For this purpose, we utilize ray. If one wants to use the parallelized version of this implementation, specify the variable actors_parallelized in property_data.InitClass with some integer greater than 0 (can also be set in main.py in the dictionary actors_parallelized).
